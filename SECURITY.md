# Security Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to protect this website from attacks, unauthorized access, and content theft.

## üîí Security Measures Implemented

### 1. HTTP Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type confusion attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables built-in XSS filtering
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Comprehensive CSP to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Permissions-Policy**: Disables unnecessary browser features

### 2. Image and Content Protection
- **Robots.txt**: Comprehensive bot blocking including AI crawlers
- **Copyright Headers**: All images tagged with copyright protection
- **Hotlink Protection**: Prevents unauthorized image embedding
- **Cache Control**: Prevents caching of sensitive content
- **No-Index Tags**: Prevents search engine indexing of images

### 3. AI Training Protection
Specific protection against AI training crawlers:
- GPTBot (OpenAI)
- ChatGPT-User
- CCBot (Common Crawl)
- anthropic-ai (Anthropic)
- Claude-Web
- Googlebot-Image
- Bingbot
- And other common AI scrapers

### 4. GitHub Security
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Pre-deployment security checks
- **Sensitive File Detection**: Prevents accidental commit of secrets
- **Build Validation**: Ensures security headers are present
- **Comprehensive .gitignore**: Blocks sensitive files from being uploaded

### 5. Server-Level Protection (.htaccess)
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Blocks common SQL injection patterns
- **Malicious Bot Blocking**: Prevents access from known bad bots
- **Directory Browsing Disabled**: Prevents file listing
- **Sensitive File Protection**: Blocks access to configuration files

## üõ°Ô∏è Copyright Protection

All images and content on this website are protected by:
- Copyright notices in HTML meta tags
- Robots.txt directives
- HTTP headers preventing indexing
- Hotlink protection
- Cache control headers

## ü§ñ AI Crawler Protection

This website actively blocks the following AI training bots:
- GPTBot, ChatGPT-User (OpenAI)
- CCBot (Common Crawl)
- anthropic-ai, Claude-Web (Anthropic)
- Googlebot-Image (Google)
- Bingbot (Microsoft)
- And many others

## üîß Implementation Details

### Security Headers
Located in `_headers` file for GitHub Pages and `.htaccess` for Apache servers.

### Meta Tags
All HTML pages include security meta tags:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `robots: noindex, nofollow, nosnippet, noarchive, noimageindex`

### Automated Deployment
GitHub Actions workflow includes:
- Pre-deployment security scans
- Sensitive file detection
- Build validation
- Security header verification

## üö® Security Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Sensitive file detection
- Hardcoded secret scanning
- SQL injection pattern detection
- HTML structure validation
- Security header verification

### Manual Reviews
- Regular security header testing
- Robots.txt validation
- Copyright protection verification
- AI crawler blocking effectiveness
