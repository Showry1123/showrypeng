This directory contains website images.

When adding images, remember to:
1.  **Compress them**: Use optimization tools.
2.  **Use modern formats**: Convert to WebP for smaller file sizes.
3.  **Name them consistently**: Use descriptive naming conventions.

This will help keep your website optimized.
