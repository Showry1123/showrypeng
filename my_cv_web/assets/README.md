This directory is for your website's images.

When adding images, remember to:
1.  **Compress them**: Use a tool like TinyPNG or ImageOptim.
2.  **Use modern formats**: Convert images to WebP for smaller file sizes.
3.  **Name them descriptively**: For example, `new-york-skyline.jpg` instead of `IMG_1234.jpg`.

This will help keep your website fast and SEO-friendly.
